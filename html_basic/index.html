  <h1>Welcome to My Cool First Webpage</h1>

  <h2>About This Page</h2>
  <p>This is my very first webpage created as part of my learning journey. It’s simple, but it’s the foundation of bigger things ahead!</p>

  <h2>Why I’m Learning HTML</h2>
  <p>HTML is the backbone of the web. By mastering it, I can create webpages, structure content, and build my own projects from scratch.</p>

  <h3>My Goals</h3>
  <p>I want to grow as a web developer, sharpen my coding skills, and build cool projects that can inspire and help others.</p>

  <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
  <p>Did you know the very first website was published in 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee? We’ve come a long way since then!</p>
